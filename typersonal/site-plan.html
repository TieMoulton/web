      <p>
        This website is a portfolio into the life of the accomplishments of cyber security. It will be able to answer all questions that people have about me. They will understand what I do and the type of projects that I am willing to do and have had accomplished. There will be many ways that I can be reached or the businesses that I have worked for information. It will have a list of all the work I have done. I think this idea is a very basic yet solid idea that I can create, especially in college, ill have the opportunity to apply what I have learned into real life. The first page or home page will introduce the idea of what I am presenting, it’ll be an over view of everything a stand for, ill make sure to add things that’ll be used to really daw the attention of who ever is willing to look at my page. This first page is a real ice breaker and it is a very important page that will have to catch the attention and make me look different than any other person that they are looking at.
