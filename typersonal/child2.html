          <h3>PROJECT 1 - Hosting with AWS</h3>
          <p>In this project, I use AWS Cloud9, an integrated development environment (IDE) that allows me to code collaboratively in real-time directly from my web browser. I write, debug, and test my applications in various programming languages within Cloud9, benefiting from its seamless integration with AWS services. Once my code is finalized, I upload it to an Amazon S3 bucket, which provides scalable, secure, and highly available storage. The S3 bucket then hosts my static website, delivering the application efficiently to users with low latency and high transfer speeds, thanks to AWS global infrastructure and robust security features. 1</p>

          <h3>PROJECT 2 - Hosting with FIREBASE</h3>
          <p>In this project, I use Googles Firebase to create and host a dynamic website with integrated authentication and data storage features. I develop the website using Firebase's tools, implementing user authentication to ensure secure access and managing user sessions seamlessly. For data storage, I utilize Firestore, Firebase's NoSQL database, to store and sync data in real-time, providing a responsive user experience. Once the website is complete, I deploy it using Firebase Hosting, which offers fast and secure hosting with automatic SSL certificates and a global CDN to ensure optimal performance and reliability for users.</p>
